My general workflow for git looks something like this:

* Think about what I want to do.
* Create a branch in git off master.
* Write really bad tests.
* Write really bad code.
* Check diffs to review what I did.
* Stage changes.
* Commit Changes.

I've been using git for about a year now, and I always accomplished checking my diff by doing git diff. I would then add my changes by generally doing `git add .` I was very pleased to learn of `git add -p`. -p will run through each diff that is eligible for staging and give you the option on whether to stage them individually. This kills two birds with one stone. I am running through my diffs, checking for anything I may have done incorrectly, and staging each diff individually, in case there is a block I do not want to commit.

Give it a try.
