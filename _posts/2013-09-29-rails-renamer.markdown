I've been trying to get a library of code up and running. This way I can refer back to it over and over in order to churn out apps quickly. One thing that I wanted to accomplish was to have the ability to rename an application. Rails doesn't make this difficult per-se, but the application name that is used on creation is buried in many different places.

So, I wrote [RailsRenamer][github-link]. It's definitely a work in progress, but it should help me out every once in a while.

One thing that RailsRenamer doesn't consider are the application secrets and cookie names. I'll have to change that.
